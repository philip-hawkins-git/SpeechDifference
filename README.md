# Transcriptions Compared
Speech Difference is a user-friendly transcription comparison tool that works with a number of media files (including mp3, wav, and mp4), and can be used from either a path, a url, or even a Youtube link!

Here's how it works:
1.   Speech Difference compares the two inputs and creates a transcript similarity score as a percentage.
2.   If the similarity score is less than 100%, Speech Difference displays the overlap in black font and potential differences in green and red font.
